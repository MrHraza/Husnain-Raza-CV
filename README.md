## User Stories

## Developer

As a Developer I want to push myself and demonstrate my ability in coding.

## Design choices

#### Colours

In this project, the color palette orchestrates a harmonious blend of seriousness and modernity. The dominant hues, a fusion of white and accents of charcoal, evoke a sense of professionalism while exuding an air of chic in my opinion. These colors symbolize Husnain's technical prowess and adaptability, embodying stability, trustworthiness, and a forward-thinking approach. Complemented by subtle gradients and highlights of matt silver, the design conveys a balance between reliability and cutting-edge innovation, creating a visually engaging experience that resonates with Husnain's personal statement as a Full Stack Developer.

#### Typography

I used two fonts on this website; Roboto and EB Garamond.
Roboto is a clean, modern font, while EB Garamond has a classic, elegant feel. Combining the two creates a great visual contrast on a CV website.

#### Imagery

Two images are placed on the website. The first is of the clients workspace and the stock image of high rise offices, an place synonymous with developers.
