This website is for employers to view my personal biography, experience/skills and see my references in the role of a full stack web developer. It was designed to present to recruiters as an intuitive website both on mobile devices and desktop.

1. **Showcase Husnain's Skills:** Present Husnain as a skilled Full Stack Developer by highlighting his technical expertise and proficiency with various technologies.

2. **User-Friendly Design:** Create an intuitive and visually appealing website layout that ensures easy navigation for visitors, allowing them to access information seamlessly.

<br>

## User Stories

<br>

In custom fashion to highlight Husnain's competence, create a personalized website  that provides information not dissimilar to a standard resume with the added bonus of being built with the skill set the candidate wishes to demonstrate experience in.

<br>

## Developer

<br>

As a Developer I want to push myself and demonstrate my ability in coding.

<br>

## Design choices

<br>

#### Colours

In this project, the color palette orchestrates a harmonious blend of seriousness and modernity. The dominant hues, white and accents of charcoal, evoke a sense of professionalism while exuding an air of chic. These colors symbolize Husnain's technical prowess and adaptability, embodying stability, trustworthiness, and a forward-thinking approach. Complemented by subtle gradient of matt silver, the design conveys a balance between reliability and cutting-edge innovation, creating a visually engaging experience that resonates with Husnain's personal statement as a Full Stack Developer.

<br>

#### Typography

I used two fonts on this website; Roboto and EB Garamond.
Roboto is a clean, modern font, while EB Garamond has a classic, elegant feel. Combining the two creates a great visual contrast on a CV website.

<br>

#### Imagery

Two images are placed on the website. The first is of the clients workspace and the stock image of high rise offices, an place synonymous with developers.

<br>

#### Site Structure

I have opted for a single-page or linear structure as it offers a seamless user experience by presenting all the essential information in a straightforward, scrollable format. It keeps things concise and avoids the need for users to navigate through different pages, making it easier for them to get a comprehensive view of the CV.

This approach is visually appealing and allows you to create smooth transitions between different sections, enhancing the overall user experience. Plus, it works well for mobile responsiveness, which is crucial since many users access websites through their phones or tablets.

## Version Control

<br>

I am definitly not satisfied with the amount of time I left myself starting this project (2 weeks). I struggled alot with understanding JS and completing course material. However, I am happy that i've manage what I have in this time and put together this CV website. Given that this project has been alot smaller in terms of content, i am happy with my commits and feel that for the amount of work i have committed more which has been a target since the last project.
